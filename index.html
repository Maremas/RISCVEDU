        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        This page aims at providing an educational introduction to the design of
        a pipelined processor hardware based on the RISC-V instruction set.
        Knowledge about the underlying instruction set and basic concepts of
        RISC-V is helpful to understand the content. <br />
        Ideally you use this website supplementary to a computer architecture
        lecture, as this website was originally designed for this purpose.
        <br />
        The content elaborates on concepts covered by
        <i
          >Computer Organization and Design RISC-V Edition: The Hardware
          Software Interface</i
        ><a href="#fn01" id="fnref01" role="doc-noteref"></a>. This website
        focusses on visualizing the fundamental elements of the processor
        datapath and pipeline. It further tries to convey the reasoning behind
        design decisions of a RISC-V processor, specifically when it comes to
        hazard handling.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Structure</b>
        <br />
        The content is divided in chapters. You can navigate through them using
        the navigation at the top of the page or by following the links on the
        bottom of every page linking to the next and previous chapters. In some
        of the chapters you find exercises and annotations, highlighted in
        boxes.
        <br />
        <br />
        This website was developed as part of a Master's project in
        collaboration with the Computer Architecture Chair at
        Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg, aimed at supporting the teaching
        of the Computer Architecture lecture.
