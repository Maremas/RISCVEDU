        <p>
          To go into detail on pipelining, we from here on use a subset of the
          RISC-V instruction set, containing the following 7 instructions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>load word (lw)</li>
          <li>store word (sw)</li>
          <li>add (add)</li>
          <li>subtract (sub)</li>
          <li>AND (and)</li>
          <li>OR (or)</li>
          <li>branch if equal (beq)</li>
        </ul>
        <a class="annotation">
          If you are not familiar with these RISC-V instructions and what they
          do, look it up before continuing.
        </a>
        <h2>Pipeline Stages</h2>
        In the pipelining introduction we viewed at the pipeline stages
        abstractly as steps in the instruction execution. We know take a closer
        look at those pipeline stages. The diagram not only depicts the stage
        procedure, but is an abstraction of the processor datapath with its
        components itself. It indicates the order in which an instruction paths
        through the processor. Every instruction passes (or bypasses) the same
        components in the same order.<br />
        In detail, the 5 pipeline stages align with the 5 main components of the
        datapath in the following ways:<br /><br />
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Instruction fetch (IF)</b><br />
            This step fetches the next instruction to be executed from the
            instruction memory (<b>InstrMem</b>).<br /><br />
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Instruction decode and register fetch (ID)</b><br />
            The instruction is decoded and values are read from registers
            <b>Reg</b> if needed. We can read two registers at once, therefore
            two output wires from the registers.<br /><br />
          </li>
          <li>
            <b
              >Execution, memory address computation or branch completion
              (EX)</b
            >
            <br />
            The <b>ALU</b> is operating on up to two (therefore 2 input wires)
            operands prepared by the previous stage. It performs one of three
            operations depending on the instruction type.<br />
            <ol>
              <li>
                Memory reference <br />
                Adding operands to calculate a data memory address.
              </li>
              <li>
                Arithmetic-logical instruction <br />
                Performing an operation specified by the instruction code on the
                two values prepared by the previous stage.
              </li>
              <li>
                Branch <br />
                Equal comparison between the two registers prepared by the
                previous stage. The output signal determines whether to branch
                or not to branch.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <br />
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Memory access (MEM)</b><br />
            Instructions which write or read access the data memory
            (<b>DataMem</b>) and read or write a value to / from the adress
            calculated by the ALU. Other instructions bypass the data memory.<br /><br />
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Write back to register (WB)</b><br />
            The instruction writes a value, e. g. the result of an addition, to
            the destination register (<b>Reg</b>), if needed.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Further, in between the stage components there are additional
          components, so called <b>pipeline registers</b>. For now, we see these
          as buffers to pass the data from one component to another between
          stages without occupying a datapath component used within a stage.<br />
          With the 5 pipeline stages above, we can have up to 5 instructions
          executing in the same datapath hardware, each in different parts of
          the datapath at the same time, moving forward through components every
          clock cycle. This resembles the principle of the laundry pipeline: we
          need just one component of every type (one washer, one dryer, one
          table), we split tasks between those separatable components and keep
          every component busy.
        </p>
        <p>
          As mentioned in the introduction, every component should only occur
          once in all stages for optimal parallelization, since we do not want
          to have conflicts between different stages trying to access the same
          component simultaneously. Indeed, every RISC-V pipeline stage above
          only adresses and uses one datapath element, and every datapath
          element, except of the registers, is used by only one stage.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Why can registers be accessed in two stages?</b><br />
          The register read has to occur before the execution stage, since we
          want to use the values read from registers as operands for the ALU
          operation. Analogously, the register write has to take place after
          execution, since we often want to store results at the end of an
          instruction.<br />
          But why can we further have write and read in the same instruction and
          especially in different stages?<br />
          The answer is simple: the write and read operations only need half a
          clock cycle to finish. Instead of leaving the register idle for the
          remainder of a clock cycle, we allow the component to be read and
          written to in the same cycle: write takes place in the first half of
          the cycle, read in the second. This not only allows it to execute
          register access parallelized: we can even read the same value, stored
          in the first half of the clock cycle, in the second half without
          worrying about a conflict.

      <div class="griditemDatapath">
        For example, we can look at the <b>add</b> instruction from the RISC-V
        instruction set. <br />
        The following instruction adds the values stored at registers x1 and x2
        and stores them to x3.<br />
        <div class="pipelinediagram instrR add x3 x1 x2"></div>
        It uses the components and wires of the datapath as specified in the
        instruction code:<br />
        First, the instruction is loaded from the instruction memory (IF). Then
        the instruction is decoded into parts and two values are read from the
        registers x1 and x2 (ID). These values are operands for the following
        addition in the ALU (EX). Afterwards, the result bypasses the data
        memory (MEM) and is stored to the register x3 (WB).
      </div>
      <div class="griditemDatapath">
        <div id="annotationColorCode" class="annotation">
          <b>Color code</b><br />
          Every instruction uses certain components of the processor hardware,
          highlighted by color. If a wire is colored, it is used to pass between
          components. Analogously, if a datapath component is colored, it is
          used:<br />
          If the left half is colored, it indicates a
          <b>write</b> interaction within the stage. <br />
          If the right half is colored, it indicates a <b>read</b> interaction
          within the stage. <br />
          Pipeline registers between the components are always colored, since
          they are used regardless of the instruction type.

        In this chapter we have seen that the RISC-V instruction set was
        designed with pipelining in mind. A datapath closely aligned by a
        5-stage pipeline separating datapath components allows executing parts
        of multiple instructions simultaneously. <br />
        In the next chapter, we take a closer look on constraints which
        nonetheless can hinder a perfectly pipelined execution even if datapath
        and instruction set are closely aligned.
