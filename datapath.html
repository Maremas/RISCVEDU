          <b>Stage description </b><br><br>
          <b>Instruction fetch</b><br>
            This step fetches the instruction from the memory and computes the address of the following instruction.<br><br>
          
            <b>Instruction decode and register fetch</b><br>
            In this step, as well as the first one, we do not yet know what the instruction is. 
            With that in mind, we can only perform actions that are either applicable to all instructions or not harmful to them. 
            Because of that we can read two registers at once, even if that is not necessary.<br><br>
          
            <b>Execution, memory address computation or branch completion</b> <br>
            In this step, the datapath operation is determined by the instruction class. 
            The ALU is operating on the prepared operands from the previous step. 
            It performs one of three functions depending on the instruction class.<br>
            <ul>
              <li>1) Memory reference <br> 
                Adding operands to form memory address.
              </li>
              <li>2) Arithmetic-logical instruction (R-type) <br>
                Performing an operation specified by optcode on the two values read from the register file in the previous cycle.
              </li>
              <li>3) Branch <br>
                Equal comparison between the two registers read in the previous step.
                Zero signal is used to determine whether to branch or not to branch.
              </li>
            </ul>
            
            <b>Memory access</b><br>
              Load or store instruction accesses memory and an arithmetic-logical instruction writes its results.
              The value is stored into the memory data register, which must be used in the next clock cycle.<br><br>
            
              <b>Write back to register</b><br>
              During this step, loaded data which was stored in the memory data register is completed by writing back the value into the register file.

          <label for="instructionOptions">Choose an instruction:</label>

        <b>Why is the diagram filled with blue color?</b><br><br>
        Every instruction uses different paths through the processor.
        The blue color shows the path every instruction takes.
        It is important to note that some stages are just colored on one half.<br>
        If a stage is colored on the left half, there is a <b>write</b> interaction within the stage.
        If a stage is colored on the right side, there is a <b>load</b> interaction within the stage.

        explain coloring of datapath and properties of elements, e. g. write and
        read both can be performed in the same clock cycle: write happens before
        read <br />
        example to show why clock cyycle has to be as long as the longest
        possible instruction
