        <h1>Control Hazards</h1>
        <p>
          A control hazard arises when an instruction can not execute in its
          planned clock cycle because the instruction that was fetched is not
          the one needed. This occurs if the pipeline executes an instruction
          which is later determined to be not branched to by the instruction
          flow.
        </p>
        <p>
          An example while doing laundry would be within the task to clean the
          uniform of a football team. Based on how dirty the laundry is, you
          need to determine how much detergent and which water temperature is
          needed to clean the laundry properly without wearing out the uniform.
          In our laundry pipeline, we would have to wait until the second stage
          to examine the dry uniform to see if it is clean enough or if we need
          to change the washer setup.
        </p>
        For control hazards there are 2 possible solutions:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Stall</b><br />
            We operate sequentially until the first load is dry and repeat until
            we have the right formula.<br />
            This solution works, but is very slow.
          </li>
          <li><b>Predict</b></li>
          We predict that we have the right formula for our task and wash the
          second load while waiting for the first one to dry.<br />
          This solution does not slow down the pipeline when guessing correctly.
          However, if we guess wrong, we need to redo the load washed before.
        </ul>
        <p>
          In a processor pipeline, the equivalent decision is the conditional
          branch instruction (beq). The problem is that the pipeline can not
          know to which instruction it should branch to at the time the next
          instruction is about to be loaded into the pipeline, since the beq
          instruction only passed the instruction fetch (IF) stage.<br />
        </p>
        Possible solutions are again:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Stall</b><br />
            We wait until the pipeline determines the outcome of the branch and
            knows what instruction adress to fetch from.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Predict</b><br />
            We use prediction to handle conditional branches. A simple approach
            is to predict that conditional branches will always be untaken. The
            pipeline proceeds, if correctly predicted, but is stalled when
            conditional branches are taken. Analogously, we could predict that
            conditional branches will always be taken or something inbetween.
          </li>
        </ul>
        There are several other approaches on when and how to predict a branch
        as untaken or taken, e. g. by keeping track of recent branch outcomes to
        predict upcoming ones. <br />
        In either case, the control logic for executing branch predictions is
        rather complex and moves away from our approach to keep an abstract view
        on pipelining and datapath, why this topic remains lightly touched.
