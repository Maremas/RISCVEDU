        <h1>Introduction to Pipelining</h1>
        <h2>What is pipelining?</h2>
        <p>
          Pipelining is a method of implementing and arranging data processing
          elements to allow the execution of multiple instructions concurrently
          by overlapping their execution. This requires thought in the design of
          hardware components and how they should be connected to enable
          pipeling efficiently.
          <br />
          If implemented succesfully, this improves efficiency, performance, and
          time consumption by breaking down tasks into smaller, independent
          stages. <br />
        </p>

        <h2>Why is pipelining useful?</h2>

        <p>
          To show the motivation for pipelining, imagine a routine like doing
          laundry. We can abstract 4 steps for <i>processing</i> a load of dirty
          laundry.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Place dirty laundry in washer</li>
          <li>When washer is finished, place laundry in dryer</li>
          <li>When dryer is finished, place laundry on table to fold</li>
          <li>When folding is finished, put clothes away</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          A simple approach would be to run through all steps, then repeat with
          a new load of clothes. This routine also takes a fixed time, because
          all stages can only proceed if the one before is completed.<br /><br />
          However, if you have multiple loads of laundry at the same time, this
          can take a long time. And actually, there is room for improvement of
          the strategy above. If we observe the steps above, every component
          (washer, dryer, table) is used in only one step and is idle in 3
          steps. <br />
          If we put a new load of clothes in the washer instantly after we
          unloaded it and move every load one step further, we can fill the idle
          time of every step and speed up the overall routine. And this without
          needing more machines or people!
        </p>
        <p>
          What we achieve with this scheduling is improving the
          <b>throughput</b> of the routine by starting the routine another time
          if it is possible to initiate the first step again.
          <br />
          But we can observe some aspects of our <i>pipeline</i> to be
          considered:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>The total time to complete the routine once does not change.</li>
          <li>
            An improvement can be only achieved if there are separate resources
            for each stage.
          </li>
        </ol>
        The effective speed-up of doing laundry using pipelining is equal to the
        number of stages in the pipeline if all stages take about the same time
        and there is enough work to do.<br />
        E. g. 20 pipelined loads of laundry take about five times as long as 1
        load, while 20 sequential loads would take 20 times as long as 1
        load.<br />
        This means pipelined laundry is potentially four times faster than
        non-pipelined!
      </div>
      <div class="griditemPipeline">
        <h2>Pipelining applied to processors</h2>
        Pipeling in processors means pipelining instruction executions.
        Analogously to laundry, we can divide the execution of a single
        instruction into steps, called <b>stages</b>.<br />
        The RISC-V instruction set is designed in a way that allows splitting
        every instruction execution into the same stages:
      </div>
      <div class="griditemPipeline">
        <ol>
          <li>Fetch instruction from memory</li>
          <li>Read registers and decode the instruction</li>
          <li>Execute an operation or calculate an address</li>
          <li>Access an operand in data memory (if necessary)</li>
          <li>Write the result into a register (if necessary)</li>
        </ol>
        Similar to the laundry approach, we consider each of these steps to use
        separate resources, so there occur no conflicts if different stage types
        are executed at the same time. The diagram illustrates the 5 stages of
        an instruction, to be read from left (Instruction Fetch from
        <b>Instr</b>uction <b>Mem</b>ory) to right (Write to <b>Reg</b>ister).
      </div>
      <div class="griditemPipeline pipelinediagram"></div>
      <div class="griditemPipeline">
        <p>
          <a class="annotation">
            We go into detail on what is happening in each of the stages in a
            later chapter.
          </a>
        </p>
        By having those 5 stages, we can now take a closer look on how the
        pipeline works and show that this method speeds up the instruction
        execution just like it speeds up doing laundry.
      </div>
      <div class="griditemPipeline">
        <h2>Difference between sequential and pipelined performance</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="griditemPipeline">
        A <b>sequential processor design</b> corresponds to the simple laundry
        approach. Every instruction is executed one after another. The stages
        can take different amounts of time since there is no need to overlap
        them, so strictly speaking, stages are not even needed. Let us assume
        that reading and writing to a register takes less time than the other
        steps (100 ps vs. 200 ps). Then the total time to finish one instruction
        is 200 ps + 100 ps + 200 ps + 200 ps + 100 ps = 800 ps.
        <br />
        For 3 instructions, this means the time between the start of the first
        and the end of the third instruction is 3 &#215; 8000 = 2400 ps.
      </div>
      <div class="griditemPipeline">
        <table id="example-singlecycle">
          <tr>
            <th colspan="5">800 ps</th>
            <th colspan="5">800 ps</th>

            <td class="pipelinediagram" colspan="5"></td>
            <td class="placeholder" colspan="5"></td>
            <td class="placeholder" colspan="5"></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="placeholder" colspan="5"></td>

            <td class="placeholder" colspan="5"></td>

          <tr>
            <td class="placeholder" colspan="5"></td>

            <td class="pipelinediagram" colspan="5"></td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </div>
      <div class="griditemPipeline">
        <p>
          Now we take a closer look at the same 3 instructions in a
          <b>pipelined processor design</b>. We want to overlap the instruction
          execution by starting the next instruction as soon as the previous one
          finished the first stage, which is equal to "leaving" the first
          resource, which would leave it idle in a sequential execution.<br />
          Any split into stages has to allow the slowest instruction part to
          always finish. The most convenient way is to define a uniform stage
          execution time that corresponds to the longest a stage can take. This
          is then called a <b>clock cycle</b> (CC) and serves as the unit of
          time in which we can safely assume one stage to be finished and the
          resource to be freed for the next instruction. In our case, we assume
          the slowest stage to take 200 ps, therefore a clock cycle takes 200
          ps. One instruction takes 5 clock cycles or 1000 ps in total to
          finish, since it is composed of 5 stages. Note that this is longer
          than the sequential instruction execution time of 800 ps.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="griditemPipeline">
        <p>
          With these assumptions made, we can now take a closer look at the
          pipeline performance. Here, the time between the start of the first
          and the end of the third instruction is just 7 &#215; 200 = 1400 ps.
          This is nearly half of the time needed by the sequential approach
          (2400 ps), regardless of the longer execution time for a single
          instruction!<br />
          For general estimations, the pipelining speed-up can be turned into a
          formula. If all stages take the same amount of time, the formula is
          roughly equal to:
        </p>
        <p>
          time between instructions<sub>pipelined</sub> =
          <span class="frac"
            ><sup>time between instructions<sub>non-pipelined</sub></sup>
            <span>/</span> <sub>number of pipeline stages</sub></span
          >
        </p>
        This implies that, if pipelining a large amount of instructions, we can
        achieve a speed-up of nearly 4x, as an instruction is completed every
        200 ps instead of every 800 ps!

      <div class="griditemPipeline">

            <th>200 ps</th>

      <div class="griditemPipeline">
        <p>
          Overall, pipelining enhances the performance by increasing the
          instruction throughput, in contrast to decreasing the execution time
          of a single instruction as achievable by sequential execution. As we
          have shown, increasing instruction throughput is more important in the
          long run because of the amount of instructions programs execute.
          <br />
          However, often there are constraints, e. g. dependencies between
          instructions, that do not allow perfect "stacking" of instructions.
          Pipeline design decisions and strategies to handle these constraints
          are described in the following chapters.
