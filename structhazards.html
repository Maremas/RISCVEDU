        <h1>Structural Hazards</h1>
        <p>
          A structural hazard occurs when a planned instruction (part) can not
          execute because the hardware does not support a certain combination of
          instructions to be executed simultaneously.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, imagine doing laundry. If you use a washer-dryer combination it
          would be impossible for you to execute your laundry pipeline. You you
          can not put new laundry in the washer after washing the first load,
          since it is used at the same time to dry the first load. <br />
          Therefore, the combination of the instruction "wash" followed by
          another "wash" is not supported by the hardware. This structural
          hazard would not occur if you have a seperate washer and dryer.
        </p>
        <p>
          The RISC-V instruction set and corresponding datapaths are designed to
          be pipelined, which makes it easy to avoid having structural hazards.
          We have already seen some design decisions preventing structural
          hazards, like strictly separated datapath components suitable for
          stage separation or having different memories for instructions and
          data.
        </p>
        <p>
          If there still occur such conflicts, the affected instruction can not
          execute and has to be delayed until there is a clock cycle in which
          the hardware is available for use again. Every clock cycle without a
          new instruction started is called a
          <b>stall</b> or "bubble", which illustrates the state of doing
          nothing.

        <h3>Exercise</h3>
        To give an example for a structural hazard, consider we designed our
        hardware to have only
        <b>one memory for both instructions and data</b>.
        <br />
        How many conflicts would occur due to conflicts caused by structural
        hazards, i. e. resource conflicts due to our memory hardware design
        choice?<br /><br />

        To recall, with cleverly designed hardware we can avoid some stalls and
        reduce needed clock cycles. This prevents having to add additional
        control logic for monitoring certain instruction combinations.<br />
        Nevertheless, there are more types of hazards that only can be solved by
        looking more precisely at instruction combinations, as shown in the next
        chapters.
