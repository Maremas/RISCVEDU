This page aims at providing an educational introduction to the design of
a pipelined processor hardware based on the RISC-V instruction set.
It was developed as part of a Master's project in
collaboration with the Computer Architecture Chair at
Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg, aimed at supplementing the teaching
of the Computer Architecture lecture there.
